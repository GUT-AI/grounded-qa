Corpus-based QA (RL)
--------------------

Criteria
^^^^^^^^

*Inclusion criteria (all of):*

* It is about Question Answering (Non-Task-Oriented Dialogue) systems
* It uses RL
* It uses an end-to-end Downstream Task
* Use of text as context (Corpus-based QA)

*Exclusion criteria (any of):*

* It is about Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD) systems
* It uses Supervised Learning
* It uses a pipeline Downstream Task
* Use of images (or video) as context (Image-based QA)
